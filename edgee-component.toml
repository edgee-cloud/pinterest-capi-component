# Pinterest CAPI Component

[https://www.edgee.cloud/edgee/pinterest-capi](https://www.edgee.cloud/edgee/pinterest-capi)

## Overview

The **Pinterest Conversions API (CAPI)** component by Edgee enables server-side integration of Pinterest CAPI, allowing you to send conversion events directly to Pinterest from your server.
This integration ensures reliable data tracking, even in the presence of ad blockers or browser limitations, by bypassing client-side restrictions.

- **Testing Mode**: Includes an optional testing mode to verify your implementation without affecting production data.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Data Accuracy**: Improves conversion tracking reliability by reducing client-side dependencies.
